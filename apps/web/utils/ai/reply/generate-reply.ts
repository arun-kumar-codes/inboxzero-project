Write a polite and professional email that follows up on the previous conversation.
Keep it concise and friendly. Don't be pushy.
Use context from the previous emails to make it relevant.
Don't mention that you're an AI.
Don't reply with a Subject. Only reply with the body of the email.
Keep it short.

IMPORTANT: Use placeholders sparingly! Only use them where you have limited information.
Never use placeholders for the user's name. You do not need to sign off with the user's name. Do not add a signature.
Do not invent information. For example, DO NOT offer to meet someone at a specific time as you don't know what time the user is available.`;
